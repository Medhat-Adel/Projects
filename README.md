# Project Overview: 
This project aims to design and implement a digital stopwatch using the ATmega32 microcontroller and six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode). The stopwatch offers two operational modes:

1. Increment Mode (Default): The stopwatch counts upwards, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds.
2. Countdown Mode: The stopwatch counts downwards from a user-defined time, functioning as a countdown timer.
   
The system includes features like reset, pause, resume, mode toggle, and time adjustments via push buttons. LED indicators and a buzzer provide visual and auditory alerts.

# Features: 
• Reset Function: Resets the time to zero in both modes.

• Pause Function: Pauses the counting, allowing the stopwatch to hold its current value.

• Resume Function: Resumes counting from the paused time.

• Mode Toggle: Switches between increment mode and countdown mode.

• Time Adjustment: Allows the user to adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds when in countdown mode.

• Alarm Function: Triggers a buzzer when the countdown reaches zero.

• LED Indicators: Indicates the current mode of the stopwatch:
   1. Red LED for increment mode.
   2. Green LED for countdown mode.

# Hardware Components: 
1. Microcontroller: ATmega32
   
2. Display: Six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), driven by a 7447 BCD to seven-segment decoder connected to PORTC.
   
3. Push Buttons:
   
     • Reset: Connected to PD2 (INT0) with an internal pull-up resistor.
  
     • Pause: Connected to PD3 (INT1) with an external pull-up resistor.

     • Resume: Connected to PB2 (INT2) with an internal pull-up resistor.
  
     • Mode Toggle: Connected to PB7.
  
  • Hour Adjustment:
  
      • Increment Hours: Connected to PB1 with an internal pull-up resistor.
      • Decrement Hours: Connected to PB0 with an internal pull-up resistor.
      
  • Minute Adjustment:
  
      • Increment Minutes: Connected to PB4 with an internal pull-up resistor.
      • Decrement Minutes: Connected to PB3 with an internal pull-up resistor.
      
  • Second Adjustment:
  
      • Increment Seconds: Connected to PB6 with an internal pull-up resistor. 
      • Decrement Seconds: Connected to PB5 with an internal pull-up resistor
      
4. Alarm/Buzzer: Connected to PD0, activated when the countdown reaches zero.

5. LED Indicators:
   
     • Red LED for increment mode (connected to PD4).

     • Green LED for countdown mode (connected to PD5).

# Operation Description: 
The stopwatch operates in two distinct modes, increment mode (default) and countdown mode, with the following functionalities:

1. Increment Mode (Default Mode):

      • Upon powering the system, the stopwatch starts in increment mode.
   
      • The time counts upward from zero, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds across six seven-segment displays.

      • The red LED (connected to PD4) turns on, indicating that the stopwatch is in increment mode.
   
      • The stopwatch continues counting until paused or reset.
   
      • The Reset Button (connected to PD2, INT0) resets the time to zero.

      • The Pause Button (connected to PD3, INT1) pauses the stopwatch.
   
      • The Resume Button (connected to PB2, INT2) resumes the counting from the paused state.

   
1. Countdown Mode:

      • The stopwatch can switch to countdown mode by pressing the Mode Toggle Button (connected to PB7).
   
      • In countdown mode, the user can set a specific time to count down from, using the adjustment buttons for hours, minutes, and seconds:
   
         • Increment/Decrement Hours: Connected to PB1 (increment) and PB0 (decrement).
         • Increment/Decrement Minutes: Connected to PB4 (increment) and PB3 (decrement).
         • Increment/Decrement Seconds: Connected to PB6 (increment) and PB5 (decrement).
      • The Green LED (connected to PD5) turns on, indicating that the stopwatch is in countdown mode.
   
      • After setting the desired time, the user can press the Resume Button (connected to PB2, INT2) to start the countdown.
   
      • When the countdown reaches zero, an alarm buzzer (connected to PD0) is activated to alert the user.

   
3. Switching Between Modes:

      • The stopwatch can toggle between increment and countdown modes using the Mode Toggle Button (connected to PB7).
   
      • The corresponding LED indicator (red for increment mode, yellow for countdown mode) will light up to reflect the current mode.

   
4. Time Adjustment in Countdown Mode:

      • In countdown mode, the stopwatch must be paused to adjust the time.
   
      • The user can then increment or decrement the hours, minutes, and seconds using the dedicated adjustment buttons.
   
      • Once the adjustments are made, pressing the Resume Button starts the countdown.

   
5. Buzzer Activation:

      • The buzzer is triggered when the countdown timer reaches zero, signaling the end of the countdown.
   
      • The buzzer remains on until manually reset or toggled by the user.
